# Busbud Coding Challenge

Adapted from a real coding challenge from a tech startup: [Busbud Backend Coding Challenge](https://github.com/busbud/coding-challenge-backend-c)

## Requirements

Design an API endpoint that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities.
The suggestions should be restricted to cities in the USA and Canada with a population above 5000 people.

- the endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
- the partial (or complete) search term is passed as a querystring parameter `q`
    - prefix match is a good minimal solution
    - can you handle typos? common abbreviations? (i.e. sf for San Francisco, or nyc for New York)
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    - the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    - each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
    - each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
    - each suggestion has a latitude and longitude
- **BONUS** the caller's location can optionally be supplied via querystring parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- all functional tests should pass
    - provided tests only verify the most basic functionality, you may want to add your own!
- the final application should be [deployed to Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- feel free to add more features!

#### Sample responses

These responses are meant to provide guidance. The exact values can vary based on the data source and scoring algorithm

**Near match**

    GET /suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "name": "London, ON, Canada",
      "latitude": "42.98339",
      "longitude": "-81.23304",
      "score": 0.9
    },
    {
      "name": "London, OH, USA",
      "latitude": "39.88645",
      "longitude": "-83.44825",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "London, KY, USA",
      "latitude": "37.12898",
      "longitude": "-84.08326",
      "score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "name": "Londontowne, MD, USA",
      "latitude": "38.93345",
      "longitude": "-76.54941",
      "score": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
```

**No match**

    GET /suggestions?q=SomeRandomCityInTheMiddleOfNowhere

```json
{
  "suggestions": []
}
```


### Other requirements

- All code should be written in Javascript
- **BONUS** Mitigations to handle high levels of traffic should be implemented
- Documentation and maintainability is a plus

## Getting Started

Begin by cloning this repo.

### Setting up the project

In the project directory run

```
npm install
```

### Running the tests

The test suite can be run with

```
npm test
```

### Starting the application

To start a local server run

```
npm start
```

which should produce output similar to

```
Server running at http://localhost:2345
```
